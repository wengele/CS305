            <h3>The First Balloon Ascent in England</h3>
            Following his own account, Lunardi's first act on finding himself fairly above the town was to fortify
            himself with some glasses of wine, and to devour the leg of a chicken. He describes the city as a vast
            beehive, St. Paul's and other churches standing out prominently; the streets shrunk to lines, and all
            humanity apparently transfixed and watching him. A little later he is equally struck with the view of
            the open country, and his ecstasy is pardonable in a novice. The verdant pastures eclipsed the visions
            of his own lands. The precision of boundaries impressed him with a sense of law and order, and of good
            administration in the country where he was a sojourner.
            <br>
            By this time he found his balloon, which had been only two-thirds full at starting, to be so distended
            that he was obliged to untie the mouth to release the strain. He also found that the condensed moisture
            round the neck had frozen. These two statements point to his having reached a considerable altitude,
            which is intelligible enough. It is, however, difficult to believe his further assertion that by the use
            of his single oar he succeeded in working himself down to within a few hundred feet of the earth. The
            descent of the balloon must, in point of fact, have been due to a copious outrush of gas at his former
            altitude. Had his oar really been effective in working the balloon down it would not have needed the
            discharge of ballast presently spoken of to cause it to reascend. Anyhow, he found himself sufficiently
            near the earth to land a passenger who was anxious to get out. His cat had not been comfortable in the
            cold upper regions, and now at its urgent appeal was deposited in a corn field, which was the point of
            first contact with the earth. It was carefully received by a country-woman, who promptly sold it to a
            gentleman on the other side of the hedge, who had been pursuing the balloon.
